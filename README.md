# Spotify - Web-Player
The project aims to create a static replica of Spotifyâ€™s web interface using HTML, CSS, and 
Bootstrap. This clone will capture the look and feel of Spotify's music streaming platform 
with a focus on layout and responsive design. The project will include a navigation bar, a 
sidebar for playlists, a main content area for featured content, and a footer with media 
controls.
